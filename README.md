# Python Projects for Beginners

Here, you will find a collection of solutions to Python exercises and projects designed for beginner programmers, more specifically those with little to no experience in coding in general. Python, with its simple English-like syntax, is an ideal language to start with for those who want to learn to code from scratch. Additionally, being a scripting language, Python does not require much overhead or boilerplate code like most object-oriented languages do, making most Python programs easier to write from scratch. 

Please note that for the sake of accessibility and simplicity, the use of more complex data structures and computing concepts, such as classes, objects, stacks etc., have been intentionally omitted from the solutions to these exercises, even if it means that the solutions can be more elegant or made shorter as a result.
